    "Sepsis, a life-threatening condition, arises from the body's exaggerated response to an infection, causing widespread inflammation, organ damage, and potential organ failure. Prompt medical intervention is essential, as sepsis is often triggered by various infections. Symptoms encompass fever, rapid heart rate, breathing difficulties, low blood pressure, and altered mental status. Treatment entails antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and supportive care. Early detection is paramount for a favorable prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project centers on the early detection and classification of sepsis, a pivotal aspect of healthcare. Timely identification markedly improves patient outcomes. The objective is to construct a robust machine learning model for sepsis classification and deploy it as a web application using FastAPI, facilitating real-time predictions.\n"
